# Test to do

- Train an RNN for the 1st one and apply this RNN on the 2nd one and see the performances



# TO DO

- Data From WF 1 and 2
- Log the time series to avoid skew distribution
- GRU model OK
- BRC/ nBRC model OK
- Make main.py to train the model OK
- checkpoint / save model OK 
- Train model (LSTM OK)
- Transformers

## Command on vega

```bash
nohup python3 main.py -c_t model/LSTM/10.model -t --rnn LSTM > file.out 2> err.log &
```
