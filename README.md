# Test to do

- Train an RNN for the 1st one and apply this RNN on the 2nd one and see the performances



# TO DO

- Data From WF 1 and 2
- Log the time series to avoid skew distribution
- GRU model
- BRC/ nBRC model
- Make main.py to train the model
- checkpoint / save model
- Train model
- Transformers
